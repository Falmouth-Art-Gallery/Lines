# Lines

## Brief

An exhibition about *Lines in our collection* is opening in October. We will have a physical interactive for people to draw lines, perhaps an instructional piece for our visitors. Can we come up with a simple digital interactive similar to the shadowpuppet setup we did before? 

> Shadowpuppet? Once upon a time we had an exhibition about shadows. There was a simple but effective digital interactive allowing people to make shadow puppets. We used a very simple setup: A wall mounted screen with a webcam on top, fed through a *Raspberry Pi* running *Proce55ing*. All it did was drop the cameras feed into bure *Black and White*, with a low *threshold*. Making everything a sillouette. Simple was effective and people loved it.

### Ideas for Lines

- Webcam tracker. a single line that you can draw. it fades after a minute. anything drawd slowly fades away or fades into a background mess.
- Webcam as a mirror of sketches. find a classic readymade scribble camera filtery thing.
- List our "Shadowpuppet Setup" kit. call out for simple interactive code sketches?
